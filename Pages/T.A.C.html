      <h2>The Maunga Club's Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <h3>Important: Please read these terms and conditions carefully.</h3>
      <p>
        All reservations made through the Maunga Club website are made subject
        to these terms and conditions, and once the reservation is accepted and
        confirmed by the Maunga Club, the person making the reservation is
        deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions on behalf of everyone
        who will be staying at the Maunga Club. www.thehotelbritomart.com is the
        URL.
      </p>
      <h3>Defintion</h3>
      <p>In these terms and conditions:</p>
      <p>- “We”, “our”, “us” mean The Maunga Club.</p>
      <p>- “You” and “your” mean the person who is making the reservation.</p>
      <h3>Gurantee Policy</h3>
      <p>
        while booking a reservation on The Maunga Club website and while
        checking into the hotel, a guarantee with a valid credit card is
        necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>Payments</h3>
      <p>At hotel check-in, a working credit card MUST be shown.</p>
      <p>
        Payments can be done at the appropriate hotel with cash, an EFTPOS
        machine, or a credit card (as stated for online reservations or as being
        accepted there).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be aware that there will be a 2% credit card transaction charge
        if you choose to settle your account with a credit card. You have the
        option of switching your payment method at checkout to cash or EFTPOS,
        which do not incur this cost. Despite the fact that you might not have
        checked out of our hotel, you agree to settle interim accounts when they
        are provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a guest does not have a pre-arranged credit facility, their credit
        card will be pre-authorized before to arrival for the whole stay + $50
        per day up to the departure date per room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credit card company reserves the pre-authorized amount for up to 10
        working days (release times may vary; please check with the issuing
        financial institution for details). Your spending limit or available
        money balance will be impacted by the pre-authorization. We advise the
        cardholder to get in touch with their issuer for further information
        about this practise. Until we process the final account on departure, we
        cannot release, withdraw, or decrease the approved amount after a
        pre-authorization has been made. This is a limitation that the bank has
        imposed on us and cannot be changed.
      </p>
      <h3>Rates and Charges</h3>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that unless you notify us that you have checked out of
        our hotel, you will pay the room cost for each day of your stay as well
        as any extra fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated, all costs are shown in New Zealand dollars per
        room, per night, and include GST.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prices are based on availability and are subject to change without
        notice due to levies and currency changes.
      </p>
      <p>There may be blackouts or special event times.</p>
      <p>
        The "from" rates listed on the website are simply estimates; they are
        also subject to availability and other restrictions. To obtain the most
        recent pricing, please choose dates and check availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terms and Conditions apply to any pricing or lodging arrangement made
        available through The Maunga Club website.
      </p>
      <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
      <p>3 p.m. is the standard check-in time.</p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that if your necessary check-in time necessitates us
        keeping the accommodation unoccupied on the preceding day, we may charge
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the number of people using the accommodation changes, you are
        responsible for notifying us and agreeing to pay any additional fees for
        those who were not originally mentioned in the register.
      </p>
      <h3>Facilities and Services</h3>
      <p>
        While every effort is made to ensure that the information on our
        facilities and services is correct, keep in mind that these things are
        often updated, altered, and sometimes taken out of commision. It is your
        duty to verify with the property, before to making your reservation,
        that any amenity or facility that is important to you in selecting a
        certain property will be available during your stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club is not responsible for any omissions, mistakes, or
        modifications to a property's amenities and services, whether temporary
        or long-term, to the degree authorised by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stated accommodations might not be available for all room types.
      </p>
      <h3>Indemnity Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Money, any valuables, products, or cars that you bring into or onto the
        room, premises, or parking lot are all your responsibility; we are not
        liable for keeping them secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to hold harmless and
        indemnify The Maunga Club and its officers, employees, and agents from
        and against any and all costs, liabilities, claims, proceedings,
        damages, judgements, and losses of any kind (including indirect and
        consequential losses, property loss or damage, and damage for injury,
        including personal injury and death) resulting from your use of this
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        You consent to hold The Maunga Club and its current and former officers,
        employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all costs,
        liabilities, claims, proceedings, damages, judgements, and losses of any
        kind (including consequential and economic losses, property loss or
        damage, and damage for injury, including personal injury and death)
        incurred or suffered by The Maunga Club or its current or former
        officers, employees, or agents as a result of, resulting from, or
        related to any violation of this agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that no tenancy or other proprietary rights have been
        formed, regardless of the length of your stay.
      </p>
      <p>
        We authorise you to remain at our hotel, but we have the right to revoke
        this authorisation at any moment.
      </p>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        The laws of New Zealand shall be used to interpret and apply these terms
        and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
