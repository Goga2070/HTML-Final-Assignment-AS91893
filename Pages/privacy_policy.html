      <h2>The Maunga Club's Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club is aware of and respects your concern for your privacy
        as well as the confidentiality and security of any information we may
        collect about you as a customer or website visitor. Your privacy is
        important to the Maunga Club. As you engage with The Maunga Club, your
        personal information will be handled in accordance with the terms of
        this privacy statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club will continue to work on giving you better, more
        personalized services as well as more effective websites as the hotel's
        website grows and technology progresses. The Maunga Club advises you to
        frequently examine our privacy statement because changes may be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club's overall approach to protecting your privacy is
        described in this privacy statement.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Personal Information Is Important to Us</h3>
      <p>
        Information that identifies you or might identify you is referred to as
        "personal information". Your name, address, contact phone number, email
        address, date of birth, passport and visa information, transaction
        information, and financial details are some examples of the personal
        information we may gather. Additionally, we could retain a record of the
        goods and services you purchase from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you provide an email address or mobile number as part of the personal
        information provided, The Maunga Club will only contact you by email or
        SMS if you consent to this method of communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club is dedicated to safeguarding your personal information
        and abiding by the Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) in the New
        Zealand Privacy Act 2020 (NZPA). Our privacy policy, in our opinion,
        adheres to industry best practises and is also fair. You may
        occasionally be able to communicate with us in an anonymous or
        fictitious manner, but there are some circumstances in which we may not
        be able to give you the information or services you require if you
        withhold certain information from us.
      </p>
      <h3>The Information We Collect About You</h3>
      <p>
        The Maunga Club only gathers personal data that is reassuringly required
        for or directly associated with one or more of its operations or
        activities. For instance, The Maunga Club gathers your personal data in
        order to supply and bill you for the hotel accommodations and other
        goods and services you request. In order to better understand your needs
        and preferences, enhance our services, and present offers that may be
        useful to you, we may also gather personal information about you. For
        instance, when you complete a contact form, we gather the information
        you provide so we may give you information. In order to better serve
        you, we preserve the information you provide when asked what you would
        like to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be circumstances in which the private data you give us or that
        we gather qualifies as "sensitive information" under the APA. According
        to the APA, "sensitive information" refers to personal data that can be
        used to determine or infer a person's racial or ethnic origin, political
        opinions, religious beliefs, or philosophical beliefs, as well as their
        membership in a professional association or trade union, their sexual
        preferences or practises, their criminal history, their health, and
        their biometric and genetic information. Only in compliance with and to
        the extent allowed by the APPs will we gather and use sensitive
        information about you.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
